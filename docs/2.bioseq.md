## module bioseq

### introduction
The `bioseq` is a collection of quite a few functions related to sequence files
(FASTA/Q) operations, such as generating an iterator for the sequence file,
convert fastq to fasta format, count gc of input string, convert sequence file
into dictionary, assess genomes traits, select sequences according to their
length from sequence file and so on.

#### import the package
```doctest
from biosut import bioseq as bq
from biosut import biosys as bs
```
#### function list:
`iterator`: sequence iterator.
```doctest
fh = bs.open_file('test.1.fastsq.gz')
for title, seq, qual in bq.iterator(fh):
    print(title, seq, qual)
    sys.exit()
```
