## module mapper

### introduction
The `mapper` module is collection of a few mappers such as bowtie2, bbmap, bwa, 
star, salmon and so on. This module will return you the sorted bam file (alignments
were sorted by leftmost coordinates, by read name when -n is used).

### import the package
```doctest
from biosut.mapper import Mapper
# first you have to instantiate Mapper
mapping = Mapper(fq1, fq2, ref, outdir, unfq=None, min_insert_size=0, 
max_insert_size=1000, cpu=20, fmt='sorted')
```

To run `bowtie2` function:
```doctest
bowtie2_sorte_bam = mapping.bowtie2()
```
