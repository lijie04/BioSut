## module aligner

### introduction
The `aligner` module is collection of a few aligners such diamond, blast and so on. This
module will return you the filter alignments table with header line.

#### import the package
```doctest
from biosut.aligner import Aligner
# first you have to instantiate Aligner
aligning = Aligner(query, subject, outdir, db_type='aa', cpu=10, 
diamond_taxdb='DIAMOND_TAXDB', tax='bacteria', identity=30, query_cov=50,
subject_cov=50, evalue=1e-10, top=1)
```

To run `diamond` function:
```doctest
diamond_filter = aligning.diamond() # diamond_filter is a pandas.DataFrame.
```

Usually, if you want to use diamond to do the annotation, all aligning functions
integrated in this module will only return you the filtered alignment table.
Thus, you need a further step to match the alignments with the comments
information of each subject in database.
